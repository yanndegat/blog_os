# Blog OS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phil-opp/blog_os.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phil-opp/blog_os) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/phil-opp/blog_os](https://badges.gitter.im/phil-opp/blog_os.svg)](https://gitter.im/phil-opp/blog_os?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository contains the source code for the _Writing an OS in Rust_ series at [os.phil-opp.com](https://os.phil-opp.com).

## Building
You need a nightly Rust compiler and the `cargo-xbuild` and `bootimage` tools. You can install the tools by executing the following command:

```
cargo install cargo-xbuild bootimage
```

Afterwards you can invoke `bootimage build` to produce a bootable disk image. Please file an issue if you run into any problems.

To run the image in [QEMU], you can execute `bootimage run`. Note that you need to have QEMU installed.

[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org/
