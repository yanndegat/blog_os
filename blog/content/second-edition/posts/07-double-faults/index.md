This post explores the double fault exception in detail, which occurs when the CPU fails to invoke an exception handler. By handling this exception we avoid fatal _triple faults_ that cause a system reset. To prevent triple faults in all cases we also set up an _Interrupt Stack Table_ to catch double faults on a separate kernel stack.

## What is a Double Fault?
In simplified terms, a double fault is a special exception that occurs when the CPU fails to invoke an exception handler. For example, it occurs when a page fault is triggered but there is no page fault handler registered in the [Interrupt Descriptor Table][IDT] (IDT). So it's kind of similar to catch-all blocks in programming languages with exceptions, e.g. `catch(...)` in C++ or `catch(Exception e)` in Java or C#.

[IDT]: ./second-edition/posts/06-cpu-exceptions/index.md#the-interrupt-descriptor-table

A double fault behaves like a normal exception. It has the vector number `8` and we can define a normal handler function for it in the IDT. It is really important to provide a double fault handler, because if a double fault is unhandled a fatal _triple fault_ occurs. Triple faults can't be caught and most hardware reacts with a system reset.

### Triggering a Double Fault
Let's provoke a double fault by triggering an exception for that we didn't define a handler function:

```rust
// in src/main.rs

#[cfg(not(test))]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    println!("Hello World{}", "!");

    blog_os::interrupts::init_idt();

    // trigger a page fault
    unsafe {
        *(0xdeadbeef as *mut u64) = 42;
    };

    println!("It did not crash!");
    loop {}
}
```

We use `unsafe` to write to the invalid address `0xdeadbeef`. The virtual address is not mapped to a physical address in the page tables, so a page fault occurs. We haven't registered a page fault handler in our [IDT], so a double fault occurs.

When we start our kernel now, we see that it enters an endless boot loop. The reason for the boot loop is the following:

1. The CPU tries to write to `0xdeadbeef`, which causes a page fault.
2. The CPU looks at the corresponding entry in the IDT and sees that the present bit isn't set. Thus, it can't call the page fault handler and a double fault occurs.
3. The CPU looks at the IDT entry of the double fault handler, but this entry is also non-present. Thus, a _triple_ fault occurs.
4. A triple fault is fatal. QEMU reacts to it like most real hardware and issues a system reset.

So in order to prevent this triple fault, we need to either provide a handler function for page faults or a double fault handler. We want to avoid triple faults in all cases, so let's start with a double fault handler that is invoked for all unhandled exception types.

## A Double Fault Handler
A double fault is a normal exception with an error code, so we can specify a handler function similar to our breakpoint handler:

```rust
// in src/interrupts.rs

lazy_static! {
    static ref IDT: InterruptDescriptorTable = {
        let mut idt = InterruptDescriptorTable::new();
        idt.breakpoint.set_handler_fn(breakpoint_handler);
        idt.double_fault.set_handler_fn(double_fault_handler); // new
        idt
    };
}

// new
extern "x86-interrupt" fn double_fault_handler(
    stack_frame: &mut ExceptionStackFrame, _error_code: u64)
{
    println!("EXCEPTION: DOUBLE FAULT\n{:#?}", stack_frame);
    loop {}
}
```

Our handler prints a short error message and dumps the exception stack frame. The error code of the double fault handler is always zero, so there's no reason to print it.

When we start our kernel now, we should see that the double fault handler is invoked:

![QEMU printing `EXCEPTION: DOUBLE FAULT` and the exception stack frame](qemu-catch-double-fault.png)

It worked! Here is what happens this time:

1. The CPU executes tries to write to `0xdeadbeef`, which causes a page fault.
2. Like before, the CPU looks at the corresponding entry in the IDT and sees that the present bit isn't set. Thus, a double fault occurs.
3. The CPU jumps to the – now present – double fault handler.

The triple fault (and the boot-loop) no longer occurs, since the CPU can now call the double fault handler.

That was quite straightforward! So why do we need a whole post for this topic? Well, we're now able to catch _most_ double faults, but there are some cases where our current approach doesn't suffice.

## Causes of Double Faults
Before we look at the special cases, we need to know the exact causes of double faults. Above, we used a pretty vague definition:

> A double fault is a special exception that occurs when the CPU fails to invoke an exception handler.

What does _“fails to invoke”_ mean exactly? The handler is not present? The handler is [swapped out]? And what happens if a handler causes exceptions itself?

[swapped out]: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-beyondphys.pdf

For example, what happens if:

1. a breakpoint exception occurs, but the corresponding handler function is swapped out?
2. a page fault occurs, but the page fault handler is swapped out?
3. a divide-by-zero handler causes a breakpoint exception, but the breakpoint handler is swapped out?
4. our kernel overflows its stack and the _guard page_ is hit?

Fortunately, the AMD64 manual ([PDF][AMD64 manual]) has an exact definition (in Section 8.2.9). According to it, a “double fault exception _can_ occur when a second exception occurs during the handling of a prior (first) exception handler”. The _“can”_ is important: Only very specific combinations of exceptions lead to a double fault. These combinations are:

First Exception | Second Exception
----------------|-----------------
[Divide-by-zero],<br>[Invalid TSS],<br>[Segment Not Present],<br>[Stack-Segment Fault],<br>[General Protection Fault] | [Invalid TSS],<br>[Segment Not Present],<br>[Stack-Segment Fault],<br>[General Protection Fault]
[Page Fault] | [Page Fault],<br>[Invalid TSS],<br>[Segment Not Present],<br>[Stack-Segment Fault],<br>[General Protection Fault]

[Divide-by-zero]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Divide-by-zero_Error
[Invalid TSS]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Invalid_TSS
[Segment Not Present]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Segment_Not_Present
[Stack-Segment Fault]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Stack-Segment_Fault
[General Protection Fault]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#General_Protection_Fault
[Page Fault]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Page_Fault


[AMD64 manual]: http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/24593_APM_v21.pdf

So for example a divide-by-zero fault followed by a page fault is fine (the page fault handler is invoked), but a divide-by-zero fault followed by a general-protection fault leads to a double fault.

With the help of this table, we can answer the first three of the above questions:

1. If a breakpoint exception occurs and the corresponding handler function is swapped out, a _page fault_ occurs and the _page fault handler_ is invoked.
2. If a page fault occurs and the page fault handler is swapped out, a _double fault_ occurs and the _double fault handler_ is invoked.
3. If a divide-by-zero handler causes a breakpoint exception, the CPU tries to invoke the breakpoint handler. If the breakpoint handler is swapped out, a _page fault_ occurs and the _page fault handler_ is invoked.

In fact, even the case of a non-present handler follows this scheme: A non-present handler causes a _segment-not-present_ exception. We didn't define a segment-not-present handler, so another segment-not-present exception occurs. According to the table, this leads to a double fault.

### Kernel Stack Overflow
Let's look at the fourth question:

> What happens if our kernel overflows its stack and the guard page is hit?

A guard page is a special memory page at the bottom of a stack that makes it possible to detect stack overflows. The page is not mapped to any physical frame, so accessing it causes a page fault instead of silently corrupting other memory. The bootloader sets up a guard page for our kernel stack, so a stack overflow causes a _page fault_.

When a page fault occurs the CPU looks up the page fault handler in the IDT and tries to push the [exception stack frame] onto the stack. However, the current stack pointer still points to the non-present guard page. Thus, a second page fault occurs, which causes a double fault (according to the above table).

[exception stack frame]: http://os.phil-opp.com/better-exception-messages.html#exceptions-in-detail

So the CPU tries to call the _double fault handler_ now. However, on a double fault the CPU tries to push the exception stack frame, too. The stack pointer still points to the guard page, so a _third_ page fault occurs, which causes a _triple fault_ and a system reboot. So our current double fault handler can't avoid a triple fault in this case.

Let's try it ourselves! We can easily provoke a kernel stack overflow by calling a function that recurses endlessly:

```rust
// in src/main.rs

#[cfg(not(test))]
#[no_mangle] // don't mangle the name of this function
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    println!("Hello World{}", "!");

    blog_os::interrupts::init_idt();

    fn stack_overflow() {
        stack_overflow(); // for each recursion, the return address is pushed
    }

    // trigger a stack overflow
    stack_overflow();

    println!("It did not crash!");
    loop {}
}
```

When we try this code in QEMU, we see that the system enters a boot-loop again.

So how can we avoid this problem? We can't omit the pushing of the exception stack frame, since the CPU itself does it. So we need to ensure somehow that the stack is always valid when a double fault exception occurs. Fortunately, the x86_64 architecture has a solution to this problem.

## Switching Stacks
The x86_64 architecture is able to switch to a predefined, known-good stack when an exception occurs. This switch happens at hardware level, so it can be performed before the CPU pushes the exception stack frame.

The switching mechanism is implemented as an _Interrupt Stack Table_ (IST). The IST is a table of 7 pointers to known-good stacks. In Rust-like pseudo code:

```rust
struct InterruptStackTable {
    stack_pointers: [Option<StackPointer>; 7],
}
```

For each exception handler, we can choose an stack from the IST through the `options` field in the corresponding [IDT entry]. For example, we could use the first stack in the IST for our double fault handler. Then the CPU would automatically switch to this stack whenever a double fault occurs. This switch would happen before anything is pushed, so it would prevent the triple fault.

[IDT entry]: ./second-edition/posts/06-cpu-exceptions/index.md#the-interrupt-descriptor-table

### The IST and TSS
The Interrupt Stack Table (IST) is part of an old legacy structure called _[Task State Segment]_ \(TSS). The TSS used to hold various information (e.g. processor register state) about a task in 32-bit mode and was for example used for [hardware context switching]. However, hardware context switching is no longer supported in 64-bit mode and the format of the TSS changed completely.

[Task State Segment]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment
[hardware context switching]: http://wiki.osdev.org/Context_Switching#Hardware_Context_Switching

On x86_64, the TSS no longer holds any task specific information at all. Instead, it holds two stack tables (the IST is one of them). The only common field between the 32-bit and 64-bit TSS is the pointer to the [I/O port permissions bitmap].

[I/O port permissions bitmap]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment#I.2FO_port_permissions

The 64-bit TSS has the following format:

Field  | Type
------ | ----------------
<span style="opacity: 0.5">(reserved)</span> | `u32`
Privilege Stack Table | `[u64; 3]`
<span style="opacity: 0.5">(reserved)</span> | `u64`
Interrupt Stack Table | `[u64; 7]`
<span style="opacity: 0.5">(reserved)</span> | `u64`
<span style="opacity: 0.5">(reserved)</span> | `u16`
I/O Map Base Address | `u16`

The _Privilege Stack Table_ is used by the CPU when the privilege level changes. For example, if an exception occurs while the CPU is in user mode (privilege level 3), the CPU normally switches to kernel mode (privilege level 0) before invoking the exception handler. In that case, the CPU would switch to the 0th stack in the Privilege Stack Table (since 0 is the target privilege level). We don't have any user mode programs yet, so we ignore this table for now.

### Creating a TSS
Let's create a new TSS that contains a separate double fault stack in its interrupt stack table. For that we need a TSS struct. Fortunately, the `x86_64` crate already contains a [`TaskStateSegment` struct] that we can use.

[`TaskStateSegment` struct]: https://docs.rs/x86_64/0.2.8/x86_64/structures/tss/struct.TaskStateSegment.html

We create the TSS in a new `gdt` module (the name will make sense later):

```rust
// in src/lib.rs

pub mod gdt;

// in src/gdt.rs

use x86_64::VirtAddr;
use x86_64::structures::tss::TaskStateSegment;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;

pub const DOUBLE_FAULT_IST_INDEX: u16 = 0;

lazy_static! {
    static ref TSS: TaskStateSegment = {
        let mut tss = TaskStateSegment::new();
        tss.interrupt_stack_table[DOUBLE_FAULT_IST_INDEX as usize] = {
            const STACK_SIZE: usize = 4096;
            static mut STACK: [u8; STACK_SIZE] = [0; STACK_SIZE];

            let stack_start = VirtAddr::from_ptr(unsafe { &STACK });
            let stack_end = stack_start + STACK_SIZE;
            stack_end
        };
        tss
    };
}
```

We use `lazy_static` because Rust's const evaluator is not yet powerful enough to do this initialization at compile time. We define that the 0th IST entry is the double fault stack (any other IST index would work too). Then we write the top address of a double fault stack to the 0th entry. We write the top address because stacks on x86 grow downwards, i.e. from high addresses to low addresses.

We don't have implemented memory management yet, so we don't have a proper way to allocate a new stack. Instead, we use a `static mut` array as stack storage for now. The `unsafe` is required because because the compiler can't guarantee race freedom when mutable statics are accessed. It is important that it is a `static mut` and not an immutable `static`, because otherwise the bootloader will map it to a read-only page. We will replace this with a proper stack allocation in a later post, then the `unsafe` will be no longer needed at this place.

Note that this double fault stack has no guard page that protects against stack overflow. This means that we should not do anything stack intensive in our double fault handler because a stack overflow might corrupt the memory below the stack.

#### Loading the TSS
Now that we created a new TSS, we need a way to tell the CPU that it should use it. Unfortunately this is a bit cumbersome, since the TSS uses the segmentation system (for historical reasons). Instead of loading the table directly, we need to add a new segment descriptor to the [Global Descriptor Table] \(GDT). Then we can load our TSS invoking the [`ltr` instruction] with the respective GDT index. (This is the reason why we named our module `gdt`.)

[Global Descriptor Table]: http://www.flingos.co.uk/docs/reference/Global-Descriptor-Table/
[`ltr` instruction]: http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_163.html

### The Global Descriptor Table
The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a relict that was used for [memory segmentation] before paging became the de facto standard. It is still needed in 64-bit mode for various things such as kernel/user mode configuration or TSS loading.

[memory segmentation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation

The GDT is a structure that contains the _segments_ of the program. It was used on older architectures to isolate programs from each other, before paging became the standard. For more information about segmentation check out the equally named chapter of the free [“Three Easy Pieces” book]. While segmentation is no longer supported in 64-bit mode, the GDT still exists. It is mostly used for two things: Switching between kernel space and user space, and loading a TSS structure.

[“Three Easy Pieces” book]: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/

#### Creating a GDT
Let's create a static `GDT` that includes a segment for our `TSS` static:

```rust
// in src/gdt.rs

use x86_64::structures::gdt::{GlobalDescriptorTable, Descriptor};

lazy_static! {
    static ref GDT: GlobalDescriptorTable = {
        let mut gdt = GlobalDescriptorTable::new();
        gdt.add_entry(Descriptor::kernel_code_segment());
        gdt.add_entry(Descriptor::tss_segment(&TSS));
        gdt
    };
}
```

We use `lazy_static` again, because Rust's const evaluator is not powerful enough yet. We create a new GDT with a code segment and a TSS segment.

#### Loading the GDT

To load our GDT we create a new `gdt::init` function, that we call from our `_start` function:

```rust
// in src/gdt.rs

pub fn init() {
    GDT.load();
}

// in src/main.rs

#[cfg(not(test))]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    println!("Hello World{}", "!");

    blog_os::gdt::init();
    blog_os::interrupts::init_idt();

    […]
}

```

Now our GDT is loaded, but we still see the boot loop on stack overflow.

### The final Steps

The problem is that the GDT segments are not yet active because the segment and TSS registers still contain the values from the old GDT. We also need to modify the double fault IDT entry so that it uses the new stack.

In summary, we need to do the following:

1. **Reload code segment register**: We changed our GDT, so we should reload `cs`, the code segment register. This is required since the old segment selector could point a different GDT descriptor now (e.g. a TSS descriptor).
2. **Load the TSS** : We loaded a GDT that contains a TSS selector, but we still need to tell the CPU that it should use that TSS.
3. **Update the IDT entry**: As soon as our TSS is loaded, the CPU has access to a valid interrupt stack table (IST). Then we can tell the CPU that it should use our new double fault stack by modifying our double fault IDT entry.

For the first two steps, we need access to the `code_selector` and `tss_selector` variables in our `gdt::init` function. We can achieve this by making them part of the static through a new `Selectors` struct:

```rust
// in src/gdt.rs

use x86_64::structures::gdt::SegmentSelector;

lazy_static! {
    static ref GDT: (GlobalDescriptorTable, Selectors) = {
        let mut gdt = GlobalDescriptorTable::new();
        let code_selector = gdt.add_entry(Descriptor::kernel_code_segment());
        let tss_selector = gdt.add_entry(Descriptor::tss_segment(&TSS));
        (gdt, Selectors { code_selector, tss_selector })
    };
}

struct Selectors {
    code_selector: SegmentSelector,
    tss_selector: SegmentSelector,
}
```

Now we can use the selectors to reload the `cs` segment register and load our `TSS`:

```rust
// in src/gdt.rs

pub fn init() {
    use x86_64::instructions::segmentation::set_cs;
    use x86_64::instructions::tables::load_tss;

    GDT.0.load();
    unsafe {
        set_cs(GDT.1.code_selector);
        load_tss(GDT.1.tss_selector);
    }
}
```

We reload the code segment register using [`set_cs`] and to load the TSS using [`load_tss`]. The functions are marked as `unsafe`, so we need an `unsafe` block to invoke them. The reason is that it might be possible to break memory safety by loading invalid selectors.

[`set_cs`]: https://docs.rs/x86_64/0.2.8/x86_64/instructions/segmentation/fn.set_cs.html
[`load_tss`]: https://docs.rs/x86_64/0.2.8/x86_64/instructions/tables/fn.load_tss.html

Now that we loaded a valid TSS and interrupt stack table, we can set the stack index for our double fault handler in the IDT:

```rust
// in src/interrupts.rs

use gdt;

lazy_static! {
    static ref IDT: InterruptDescriptorTable = {
        let mut idt = InterruptDescriptorTable::new();
        idt.breakpoint.set_handler_fn(breakpoint_handler);
        unsafe {
            idt.double_fault.set_handler_fn(double_fault_handler)
                .set_stack_index(gdt::DOUBLE_FAULT_IST_INDEX); // new
        }

        idt
    };
}
```

The `set_stack_index` method is unsafe because the the caller must ensure that the used index is valid and not already used for another exception.

That's it! Now the CPU should switch to the double fault stack whenever a double fault occurs. Thus, we are able to catch _all_ double faults, including kernel stack overflows:

![QEMU printing `EXCEPTION: DOUBLE FAULT` and a dump of the exception stack frame](qemu-double-fault-on-stack-overflow.png)

From now on we should never see a triple fault again!

To ensure that we don't accidentally break the above, we should add a integration test for this. We don't show the code here for space reasons, but you can find it [on Github][stack overflow test]. The idea is to do a `serial_println!("ok");` from the double fault handler to ensure that it is called. The rest of the file is is very similar to our `main.rs`.

[stack overflow test]: https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/blob/master/src/bin/test-exception-double-fault-stack-overflow.rs

## Summary
In this post we learned what a double fault is and under which conditions it occurs. We added a basic double fault handler that prints an error message and added an integration test for it.

We also enabled the hardware supported stack switching on double fault exceptions so that it also works on stack overflow. While implementing it, we learned about the task state segment (TSS), the contained interrupt stack table (IST), and the global descriptor table (GDT), which was used for segmentation on older architectures.

## What's next?
The next post explains how to handle interrupts from external devices such as timers, keyboards, or network controllers. These hardware interrupts are very similar to exceptions, e.g. they are also dispatched through the IDT. However, unlike exceptions, they don't arise directly on the CPU. Instead, an _interrupt controller_ aggregates these interrupts and forwards them to CPU depending on their priority. In the next we will explore the [Intel 8259] \(“PIC”) interrupt controller and learn how to implement keyboard support.
